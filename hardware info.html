<h1>Hardware Information</h1>
<p class="serif">When building a PC, you need to know what parts you need for your machine. These parts are your CPU, motherboard, video card (or a CPU with integrated graphics), power supply, RAM, storage, and a case. With all of this in mind, you will need to allocate your money to the different parts according to your budget.</p>
